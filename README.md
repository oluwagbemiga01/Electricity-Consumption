**Tools Used**:
- Power BI
- DAX 
- Power Query

1. ## Project Overview
   - This project aims to **analyze patterns in electricity consumption** over time and explore the relationships between power usage and other temporal factors.
   - The dataset contains the following features:
        - Real Consumption
        - Predicted Consumption
        - Time
 
   - The key objectives include:
     
          1. Identifying peak consumption hours 🕒  
          2. Analyzing trends in energy usage 📈
          3. Providing data driven recommendations for energy optimization 🧰

2. ## Dataset Information
   - **Source**: This [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/qubdidata/electric-power-consumption?select=Power+Consumption+Data.csv) contains live electric power consumption data from Gerogia, spanning the years 2020 to 2024.
   - **Columns**:
         - Date & Time (Timestamp of power usage)
         - Consumption (MW) (Energy used at each time interval)
         - Day of the week (Derived from the Time column)

  3. ## Data Cleaning & Preparation
      - I checked for **missing values** and also formatted the dataset properly.
      - Time intelligence analysis was also implemented to effectively work with my date & time.
      - I also extracted additional time-related features (Hour, Day, Month, AM/PM format).
